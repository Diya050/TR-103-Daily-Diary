## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

### What is AI?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a machine to learn patterns and make predictions. AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI adds value to human judgment. 

In its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving.

### What is the difference between AI and augmented intelligence?
> When learning about artificial intelligence, you’ll come across the term augmented intelligence. Both terms share the same objective, but have different approaches. 
- Augmented intelligence has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do. For example, “reading” 1000 pages in an hour.
- In contrast, artificial intelligence has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and processes.
However, it’s important to note that AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.

#### Real-Life Analogy: My Commute

Driving to work involves three forms of intelligence:
- Human intelligence – Used for basic driving tasks like steering and checking mirrors.
- Artificial Intelligence: Took over on the highway via the car’s self-driving mode—managing speed, lane control, and safe distance with no human input.
- Augmented Intelligence: Kicked in with features like collision detection and blind spot warnings, which assisted the driver without replacing them.
It made me realize: AI replaces, but Augmented AI empowers.

#### Key Differences:

* **AI**: Replaces human decision-making to perform tasks such as reasoning, problem-solving, and communication.
* **Augmented Intelligence**: Enhances human abilities through technology—like screen readers or driver-assist tools.

#### Strengths Matrix:

| Strengths           | Humans    | Machines (AI)          |
| ------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| Data Processing     | Limited   | Fast and high-volume   |
| Creativity          | Strong    | Weak                   |
| Emotional Skills    | Excellent | Lacking                |
| Accuracy in Repeats | Can vary  | Consistent and precise |

**Conclusion**: The best results often come from **both AI and humans working together**—a balance found in **Augmented Intelligence**.

### What continues to drive the development of AI? 

As computing power and algorithms become more powerful and data volumes increase, companies will adopt new use cases for AI technologies. Companies will embed smart systems into their applications to drive innovation and efficiencies, enhance employee experience, automate tasks, decrease costs, and improve revenue.

### What does AI do?

> Artificial intelligence machines (researchers call them “AI services”) don’t think. They calculate. <br>

They represent some of the newest, most sophisticated calculating machines in human history. Some can perform what’s called machine learning as they acquire new data. Others, using calculations arranged in ways inspired by neurons in the human brain, can even perform deep learning with multiple levels of calculations.

#### Task

> Imagine you are given the job to sort items in the produce department at a grocery store. You realize that there are dozens of products and very little time to sort them manually. How could you use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning to help with your work?

#### Artificial Intelligence:

To separate the stone fruits, berries, and tropical fruits, you could create **a programmed rule in the format of if-else statements**. This allows the machine to recognize what is on the label and route it to the correct basket. 

A programmed rule might look something like this:

```
if berries_is_on_label:
   route_items_to_center_basket()

else:
   redirect_item_to_main_basket()
```
 
Artificial intelligence makes this process more efficient.<br><br>

#### Machine Learning:

To improve the performance of the machine, you expose it to more data to ensure that the **machine is trained on numerous characteristics of each type of fruit**. The more data you provide for the algorithm, the better the model gets. By providing more data and adjusting parameters, the machine minimizes errors by repetitive guess work.

#### Deep Learning:

The grocery store has expanded its produce selection to include more varieties such as nectarines and plums (stone fruits), blackberries and cranberries (berries), and mangoes and star fruit (tropical fruits). In addition, the products now come in different sizes, shapes, and colors. What makes deep learning different?

Deep learning models **eliminate the need for feature extractions**. For your work in the product department, you decide to use algorithms based on deep learning to sort fruit by removing the need to define what each product looks like. Feature extraction is built into the process without human input. Once you have provided the deep learning model with dozens of fruit pictures, it processes the images through different layers of neural networks. The layers can then learn an implicit representation of the raw data on their own.

### How do AI services calculate?

- **Analyze**: AI services can take in (or “ingest”) enormous amounts of data. They can apply mathematical calculations to analyze data, sorting and organizing it in ways that would have been considered impossible only a few years ago.
- **Prediction**: AI services can use their data analysis to make predictions. They can, in effect, say, “Based on this information, a certain thing will probably happen.”

### What predictions can AI make?

Most people have a love-hate relationship with the autocorrect feature on phones or computers. What’s happening when you enter a misspelled word? And how does the machine know to suggest a better spelling?

Simply put, the software analyzes what you’ve typed so far and predicts a likely correction. Your phone or computer (or its online service) has more than just a dictionary of correct spellings. It has a huge library of phrases that humans use in certain contexts on many subjects. So, when you enter a word that’s not in its dictionary, it begins analyzing and predicting and suggests the word you need. Predictions aren’t always accurate. But if they’re correct often enough, they’re useful and can save you time.

- **Human Language**: Online chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze poorly typed or spoken questions, then predict which answers to give on topics ranging from shipping or business hours to merchandise and sizes.
- **Vision Learning**: AI helps doctors identify serious diseases based on unusual symptoms and early-warning signs, and it reads speed limit and stop signs as it guides cars through traffic.
- **Fraud Detection**: AI analyzes patterns created when thousands of bank customers make credit card purchases, then predicts which charges might be the result of identity theft.

### How is AI evolving?

Computer scientists have identified three levels of AI based on predicted growth in its ability to analyze data and make predictions. They call these levels:
- Narrow AI
- Broad AI
- General AI

#### Narrow AI:

- Narrow AI is focused on addressing a single task such as predicting your next purchase or planning your day. 
- Narrow AI is scaling very quickly in the consumer world, in which there are a lot of common tasks and data to train AI systems. For example, you can buy a book with a voice-based device. 
- Narrow AI also enables robust applications, such as using Siri on an iPhone, the Amazon recommendation engine, autonomous vehicles, and more. Narrow AI systems like Siri have conversational capabilities, but only if you stick to the script.

#### Broad AI:

- Broad AI is a midpoint between Narrow and General AI. 
- Rather than being limited to a single task, Broad AI systems are more versatile and can handle a wider range of related tasks. 
- Broad AI is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system. 
- Newer Broad AI systems predict global weather, trace pandemics, and help businesses predict future trends.

#### General AI:

- General AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. 
- Currently, AI does not have the ability to think abstractly, strategize, and use previous experiences to come up with new, creative ideas as humans do, such as inventing a new product or responding to people with appropriate emotions. And don't worry, AI is nowhere near this point.

There might be another level, known as artificial superintelligence (ASI) that could appear near the end of this century. Then machines might become self-aware! Even then, no levels of AI are expected to replace or dominate you. Instead, scientists hope AI will extend humans’ ability to lead richer lives.
