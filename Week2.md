## Machine learning models

Machine learning is, in the end, about making predictions using **statistics and calculus**; both of which are used in bits of code called **machine learning algorithms**. These bits of code, in turn, can be organized in large-scale computer programs called **machine learning models**. Your understanding of machine learning and how it’s executed in **IBM Watson Studio** starts with an exploration of these two concepts.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** A machine learning algorithm is a set of program code. If you’ve ever worked with code, you might know what a function is. A function is a set of logical operations that inputs some sort of data, analyzes or transforms it, and then outputs a result. But in a machine learning algorithm, that **analysis often has a specific goal: to recognize patterns in data sets**. For example, an algorithm in an AI weather prediction system might ingest a series of sunlight measurements and water temperatures, then analyze and output a pattern describing how these factors appear to influence each other.
- **Machine Learning Models:** A machine learning model is a group of machine learning algorithms. Operating together, they detect patterns among their algorithms’ output and use those patterns **to make predictions**. For example, a model whose algorithms look at patterns regarding temperature, climate, geography, and so on might predict a rainy-day next Saturday.

How is this different from the way conventional computer programs operate? A machine learning model doesn’t depend only on a human to write its code or to adjust its programming if its predictions aren’t right. Instead, **a machine learning model can reprogram itself**. So if, for example, a weather model tends to get a certain type of prediction wrong, it can adjust its algorithms (weights and biases, statistical constructs) to improve the accuracy of its predictions.

Why are you learning about this? Because creating machine learning models is the primary job of IBM Watson Studio. Its integrated development environment (IDE) makes this difficult task easier, faster, and more affordable. This is the future of computer programming.

## Watson Studio was born from a need

Until about 2015, artificial intelligence scientists found that building AI systems was **cumbersome and time-consuming**. They might need to search the web, review components, hand-code connections to big data tools and learn to use them, and more. This was an **expensive problem** for laboratories and companies trying to develop and market useful systems.

Even worse, working with AI **broke up workflows**. Developers toggled from one technology to another, jumping back and forth between workspaces, and repeatedly switching programming tools to get tasks done.

These problems slowed down the adoption of AI systems, making it **hard to integrate them into existing technology** such as medical care or automobiles. Once all the elements were working together and launched, it was difficult to provide support when help was needed.


## IBM Watson Studio fulfills the need

IBM’s Watson Studio solution is what researchers call an integrated development environment (IDE). Named after IBM’s founder, it pulls together the most useful development and analytic tools, wrapping them in a development platform that is powerful enough to meet large-scale challenges, yet simple enough that developers can master it quickly.

IBM Watson Studio solves AI development problems. With IBM Watson Studio, businesses can simplify data projects with a streamlined process to extract insights from data to help them get smarter faster. It delivers an easy-to-use, collaborative data science and machine learning environment to build and train models, prepare and analyze data, and share insights all in one place.

IBM Watson Studio is a single environment for sharing work to solve problems within the system, rather than starting from scratch every time a new issue arises. And developers can use that efficiency to quickly dive into building machine learning and deep learning algorithms. 

Watson Studio gives developers:

- A collaborative data science and machine learning environment
- Easy visualizations with drag-and-drop code
- An efficient workflow
- A built-in neural network modeler
- Open-source tools such as Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio

Watson Studio’s features sound impressive. But do they really make a difference? Read on to learn how they help developers working on real-world projects.

## IBM Watson Studio speeds data input and insights output

Watson Studio is more than a collection of resources that can communicate with each other. It eases ingesting data into an AI system, organizes assets, performs complex analysis, and displays results that make complicated issues simpler to understand.


- **Automated data preparation:** 
IBM Watson Studio has a feature called AutoAI that prepares raw data for machine learning. It can apply various algorithms to clean and structure the data, automatically select an appropriate model, and optimize its output for the fastest, most useful output.

- **Visual neural network design:** 
Watson Studio helps developers create machine learning flows and design neural networks visually, using a simple drag-and-drop interface and open source code libraries.

- **Sophisticated analysis and prediction:** 
Watson Studio recommends algorithms and uses the latest neural networks to predict and build patterns. It helps programmers create visualizations simply by selecting data items, after which the system itself can choose the best way to visualize its findings.


- **Unified dashboard displays:** 
Watson Studio dashboards not only visualize the results of complex analyses, they also gather related views on data into a single place where clients can find and understand the information they seek. These dashboards don’t require specialized coding or database skills, and researchers can easily share them across the internet.

IBM Watson Studio is designed to make data science a team sport that helps developers learn, create, and collaborate on great machine learning models. 

## When a classical computer program is not enough

Today businesses, industries, and governments need more computing power than seemed enough just a few years ago. They depend on data analysis that can only be developed from machine learning models, using tools like IBM Watson Studio.

Consider, for example, the problem faced by a sneaker manufacturer that wants to know what customers think and say about its products. This information could help it plan product distribution for today and keep up with new trends in the future. The best way to discover these things might be to study product reviews people have posted, and also study IM texts sent by the manufacturer’s teen and young adult customers. What are they saying? What do they love or hate? What new thing did they just see that they really want to buy?

Here are some of the things that make this discovery difficult.

- Millions of social media posts hit the internet every hour across Twitter, TikTok, and others.
- Those posts cover zillions of topics, most of which have nothing to do with sneakers.
- Posts that do mention sneakers might do so in countless different contexts.

Even if a conventional computer could be programmed and given enormous resources to keep up with this flood of data, sneaker fashions change without warning—and those changes cannot be predicted or prepared for with traditional program code.

But with IBM Watson Studio, a modest-size team of specialists could build a machine learning model that will, as time goes by, get better and better at spotting major trends in sneaker design. It could even follow celebrity fashions, then begin predicting new trends more and more effectively.

# DAY - 8

## Your AI machine learning project

Imagine that you’re an up-and-coming coder looking for your big break. Yesterday, you got a phone call from a major bank in Germany. A few hours later you found yourself flying across the ocean on a transcontinental jet! This could be your chance to make your name in AI machine learning. You leaned your seat forward and studied the materials that the bank sent you.

## A terrific opportunity

The bank wants to protect itself from the risk of making loans that are never repaid.

- It’s preparing to launch a new website on which customers can submit requests for loans up to €10,000 and, if their credit is sound, get instant approval.
- The good news is that this will **attract customers** who want to apply for loans quickly, **without a lot of fuss**.
- The bad news is that it will give the **bank almost no time to investigate **each applicant’s credit risk, then reject those who might default on their loan, ultimately costing the bank millions of euros.

The bank wants you to lead the development of an AI machine learning system that can **rapidly predict the risk of granting a loan** for each customer who applies.

## The scope of your experiment

Using simulations of IBM Watson Studio, you’ll build an AI machine learning model, train algorithms on the same data set of bank loans and defaults, then test them competitively, using additional data, to see which predicts defaults most accurately.

## Your data set

You’ll use data from a real German bank that’s fictionalized for this simulation.
The file contains records of five thousand past loans.
Each record includes ample data such as the customer’s credit rating, bank account balances, loan purpose, and more—and whether the borrower paid or defaulted on the loan.

## Your to-do list
Using IBM Watson Studio and a data set, you will simulate the following steps.

- Set up a new project in IBM Watson Studio.
- Create a learning model designed to predict whether an applicant is more likely to pay back or default on a loan.
- Train your model on 90% of your data set, including loan outcomes.
- Test the model on a test set of data (the remaining 10% of the data in the data set) to see which algorithm gives the best predictions.
- Save the final model with highest confidence as a Jupyter notebook.

## What is prompt tuning?

**Large language models** like ChatGPT **are flexible and can perform various tasks** such as analyzing legal documents or writing poems. Previously, **fine tuning was used to improve the performance of pre-trained models by gathering and labeling examples of the target task**. However, a more energy-efficient technique called prompt tuning has emerged as a simpler alternative. **Prompt tuning allows tailoring a massive model to a narrow task without requiring a large number of labeled examples.** 

It involves **feeding task-specific cues or prompts** to the model, which can be human-generated or AI-generated. P**rompt engineering is the development of prompts that guide models to perform specialized tasks.** Soft prompts, generated by AI, have been shown to outperform human-engineered prompts and are used in prompt tuning. They act as a substitute for additional training data. **Prompt tuning and soft prompts lack interpretability but are effective in guiding the model towards desired outputs.** Prompt tuning is proving to be a game changer in multitask learning and continual learning, allowing for swift adaptation to specialized tasks and concepts.

## Can AI help climate change?

This video discusses the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and climate change, specifically focusing on the role of AI in developing new materials to address the issue. The goal is **to mitigate climate change by developing low carbon technologies**.

Existing technologies face **challenges related to performance, toxicity, and stability, which impact their adoption and cost.** The **complexity of exploring various materials, processes, and operating conditions in a traditional laboratory** setting makes the problem difficult to solve. AI can play a crucial role by speeding up and enhancing the scientific method. It can **aid in generating hypotheses through natural language processing, analyzing vast amounts of scientific literature, and making meaningful connections between materials and properties. AI techniques, such as generative modeling, machine learning, and quantum chemistry, can predict and assess new materials and their performance before physical experimentation.**

AI-enhanced **simulations allow for efficient testing of materials under different conditions**, leading to the discovery of promising candidates. AI can also **optimize synthesis routes and automate laboratory processes, generating data to improve models and expand the scientific knowledge graph.** The integration of AI with the scientific method is expected to accelerate material discovery and have a significant impact on addressing climate change in the coming years.
